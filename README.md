# Guitar-Utils

# Purpose
**poking around in go, gettin' it.**

# Utility
If further developed, will eventually provide distances between guitar tunings: my playing style often warrants 
drop tunings, so let's say I want to *melt someone's face* in Drop A. I could pass, again eventually, AEADGB as an arg to the script.
This would in turn tell me, for each string, how many semitones to tune down/up. 

# todo

- [ ] semitones to note names and vice versa
- [ ] distance between two frets/notes on fretboard, proportional to scale length; local  JS impl could be ported to golang
- [ ] Audio in Go? Popular libraries? standard one exists?

**more to come, i'm sure.**
Right now I'm simply getting a feel for golang, assessing its strengths/weaknesses and figuring out which tool it 
will/can/should become in my proverbial toolbelt.
